## Project
### Project Goals
The main objective of this project was to create a website for a restaurant, providing customers with the opportunity to explore the offer. In addition to allowing users to reserve a table as members or first-time visitors, the application allows these users to update or delete their own reservations. Staff members, on the other hand, can create reservations for customers and have the authority to modify or delete them. In summary, the site aims to offer a comprehensive experience for users and staff in discovering the restaurant and managing reservations.

### User Goals

 # UX

### **Audience Definition**

A restaurant is a limited space where not everyone can be accommodated. This place aims to offer future customers a pleasant and friendly experience for a defined period. Regarding the website, it should reflect the type of restaurant, enabling the filtering of a specific clientele. The determination of the potential customer begins with the visit to the website, where they can get an idea of the place.


### **User Stories**

Here is a concise list of actions that a potential user might consider during their visit to this website:

As a user, I want to:

Land on a homepage presenting the core content of the site and providing intuitive navigation.
Access a menu section to get an overview of the available options.
Learn more about the restaurant and its features.
Make a reservation without having to subscribe to a newsletter or other services.
Second Visit:

As a subscribed user, I want to:

Be able to register on the site to create an account allowing access to the history and future reservations.
Make new reservations as a registered user.
Have the option to modify and/or delete the reservations I've made.
Be able to log out and log back into the site without encountering any specific difficulties.

Input validation and error checking.

# Features to Implement in the Future Versions

While the website fulfills the basic functions of a restaurant site, there are additional features that could be added:
Visual Gallery: Integrate an attractive photo gallery showcasing the restaurant's ambiance, popular dishes, and special moments to give visitors a better idea of the experience they can expect.

Reviews and Testimonials: Add a section where customers can leave reviews and testimonials. 
Implementation of a personalized and effective newsletter service that stands out from other newsletter services.
Integration of a system to send discounts to registered users.
Online Loyalty Program: Establish an online loyalty program to reward frequent customers with special offers, discounts, or exclusive benefits.
Reservation Customization Options: Offer customers the ability to specify special requests during reservations, such as dietary preferences or particular celebrations.


## Planning
Project planning was done with Agile methodologies.


## Website Design

Color Palette:

Primary (Background): #abb8c3 (a shade of gray-blue)
--white-Smoke: #F9F9F9; 
Text: green #497569 
The primary background (gray-blue) will provide an interesting visual contrast.

## Fonts:

Headings: Playfair Display (serif)

Body Text: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif

Playfair Display is a serif font that adds a touch of elegance.

I use the same color palette throughout the entire site to create a cohesive and harmonious experience.
